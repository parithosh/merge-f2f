# merge-f2f
This repo is for scripts to run various clients at the merge f2f.

## How To Run
This testnet requires 3 terminal processes, one for a execution client one for a consensus node and one for a consensus validator. 
 Go to each folder that you want to run and run the required commands in the `README.md` file.

Lots of info taken from [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse-merge-f2f), thanks!
